#favourite_videos

favourite_videos allows you to store a list your favourite **Movies** and **TV shows** and then generates a static web page to browse the videos and watch the trailers.

#Quickstart

###Install
    import media
    import fresh_tomatoes

###Examples
If I were writing these out as _code_, it might look something like this:

    if bowl is empty:
        add cereal
    if bowl only has cereal in it:
        add milk

#Issues / Limitations
Both a _Movie_ and  _TV-show_ object(s) need to be defined and passed to the function `open_videos_page(movie, tv_show)` in a list format to get an output of a static web page.

#License
You can do whatever you want with it.
